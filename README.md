# hdpc-dl

A downloader for HDPC.

Crawls a specified URL, writes all images and a JSON file to the working directory, or another directory if specified. If the directory does not already exist, its creation will be attempted.

Notice: The crawler was built specifically for HDPC and will not work for any other website. `example.com` (as shown below) would not work.

## Usage

The application is very easy to use, it only takes a URL, and an optional destination path (defaults to the working directory).

### Guide

1. `cargo install hdpc-dl`
2. `hdpc-dc https://example.com/target_url -d /home/b42-sneak/Downloads/HDPC`
3. A folder will be created: `/home/b42-sneak/Downloads/HDPC/Name-of-the-target`
4. In this folder ([...] `Name-of-the-target`) a JSON file will be created including all target metadata called `hdpc-info.json`
5. All images will be downloaded into the same directory, prefixed with an incrementing counter starting at `001-`
